==[ Foreword ]==
This version is completely redesigned with a fancy new look of CAPTCHA.
In order to simplify the the usage, I also redisgned the interface.

The newest Version can be found at [1].

==[ Requirements ]==
- PHP >= 4.0.1
- TTF support
- Some fonts

==[ Fonts ]==
Before you can start using this class, you need some fonts.

You can either get the font-package [2] or some other fonts [3].
When you got one or more fonts, just put them into the 
font directory and they will be used randomly.

==[ Usage ]==
It's realy easy to use this class.

Example:

Generatin a CAPTCHA:

  $captcha = new captcha();

To geht the string shown in the CAPTCHA use this:

  $CaptchaString = $captcha->GetCaptchaString();

See example.php and captcha.php for a detailed example.

That's it :)
